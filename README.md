## Objective

Connect an Express server to an SQLite database and expose Create, Read, Update and Delete (CRUD) operations over HTTP.

## Project files

- `app.js` — Express server, database connection and five CRUD routes.
- `books.db` — SQLite database containing 10 sample book records.
- `seed.sql` — SQL schema and sample INSERT statements.
- `postman_collection.json` — requests for testing all five endpoints.
- `test-api.js` — automated end-to-end API check using Node's built-in `fetch`.
- `.env.example` — example configuration; do not commit a real `.env` file.

## Requirements

- Node.js 18 or later
- npm

## How to install and run

1. Open a terminal in the `lab-02` folder.
2. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. (Optional) Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and change the values if needed. The defaults are `PORT=3000` and `DB_PATH=./books.db`. Do not commit `.env`.
4. Start with automatic restart during development:

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

   Or start normally:

   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

5. The server runs at `http://localhost:3000` by default.

The database connection is awaited before the server starts. The table is created automatically if it does not already exist.

## Endpoints

| Method | Path | Description | Success status |
|---|---|---|---|
| GET | `/books/` | Retrieve all books. | 200 OK |
| GET | `/books/:bookId/` | Retrieve one book using its ID. | 200 OK |
| POST | `/books/` | Add a book. | 201 Created |
| PUT | `/books/:bookId/` | Replace a book's title, author, price and page count. | 200 OK |
| DELETE | `/books/:bookId/` | Delete a book using its ID. | 200 OK |

### POST and PUT request body

Send JSON with all four fields. `title` and `author` must be non-empty strings; `price` must be a non-negative integer; `pages` must be a positive integer.

```json
{
  "title": "Sample Book",
  "author": "Sample Author",
  "price": 300,
  "pages": 200
}
```

Invalid input returns `400 Bad Request`; a valid ID that does not exist returns `404 Not Found`. Unexpected server/database errors return `500 Internal Server Error`.

## Testing

### Postman

Import `postman_collection.json` into Postman. Start the server and run the requests in this order: Get all books, Get one book, Add a book, Update a book, Delete a book. The collection uses `http://localhost:3000` as its base URL and stores the created ID in a collection variable.

### Automated API test

With the server running in one terminal, open a second terminal and run:

```bash
npm run test:api
```

The script checks all five routes, verifies that a deleted book returns 404, and prints the response status and body. It creates and deletes its own test record.

### SQLite CLI verification

If the SQLite CLI is installed, run:

```bash
sqlite3 books.db
SELECT * FROM book;
.quit
```

Run the SELECT statement again after POST, PUT and DELETE to confirm that the database changes.

## Screenshots

Create a `screenshots/` folder and add genuine screenshots from your own Postman run and SQLite CLI verification. Suggested filenames:

- `get-all-books.png`
- `get-one-book.png`
- `post-book.png`
- `put-book.png`
- `delete-book.png`
- `sqlite-database.png`

Insert them here after capturing:

```md
![GET all books](screenshots/get-all-books.png)
![GET one book](screenshots/get-one-book.png)
![POST book](screenshots/post-book.png)
![PUT book](screenshots/put-book.png)
![DELETE book](screenshots/delete-book.png)
![SQLite database](screenshots/sqlite-database.png)
```

## Notes: problems faced and how they were solved

- The server must not accept requests before the database connection is ready. This is handled by awaiting the SQLite connection inside `initializeDBAndServer()` before calling `app.listen()`.
- User input is passed through `?` placeholders and parameter arrays. This avoids building SQL statements by concatenating user input and helps prevent SQL injection.
- Route handlers use `async/await` so database operations complete before the HTTP response is sent.
- Input validation and appropriate HTTP status codes are used for invalid data and missing book IDs.

## Viva preparation

**1. Why await the database call?**  
`await` pauses the async function until the database operation finishes. This ensures that the application does not use a database connection or query result before it is ready.

**2. What is SQL injection and how do placeholders prevent it?**  
SQL injection is an attack in which malicious input changes the meaning of an SQL query. Parameterised queries keep SQL instructions separate from user-supplied values, so values are treated as data rather than executable SQL.

**3. When is PUT used instead of POST?**  
POST is used to create a new resource. PUT is used to update or replace an existing resource identified by its URL, such as `/books/3/`.

## Git submission checklist

- Place this folder inside the course repository as `lab-02/`.
- Keep the repository public or share it with the faculty.
- Do not commit `node_modules/` or `.env`.
- Commit regularly with meaningful messages.
- Add the real Postman and SQLite screenshots before submission.
